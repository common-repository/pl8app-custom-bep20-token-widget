Add Custom BEP20 token prices to your site with this Widget from pl8app

== Description ==

This is a simple WP plugin developed by ourselves using API from Coingecko and CoinMarketCap . Any pricing differences will be based on the exchanges used as we take our price only from CoinMarketCap, however this should provide a relatively accurate price for coins which are not listed on the regular exchanges.

We provide this plugin for free under the following licenses

“GPLv2 or later.”

The front end will display the time the price was taken at (server time), how many units of what particular currency you want to convert, the currency to convert, then how many tokens of the selected type, the token name and the token logo.

The backend within WP admin allows users to add any custom BEP20 token based on contract address only, you will also have the opportunity to add a logo file for that cryptocurrency on the back end.

Shortcode - [token_widget] will display this widget on the front end of your WP pages.

= About pl8app =

We at pl8app have been developing various solutions since 2013, first being a simple Android based food review 
application. Essentially an app to take photos (and review) your plate, hence the name pl8app.

We have then developed ordering and time slot booking systems and solutions for the UK based Hospitality and Takwaway markets , more information can be seen at https://pl8app.co.uk (please note, we only sell to the UK due to our business policies, we actively Geofence this website from any other country to avoid any sign ups from Geographical areas we do not cater for.

Looking into the future, we developed our own BEP20 based token ( Contract Address 0xb77178a0fdead814296eae631be8e8171c02592b ) , this developed from the idea that many popular payment solutions these days can prove expensive, so we made a viable token with only 2% fees (1% of which is reflected back to our holders) to give the businesses we support by our solutions a fair alternative, with low fees and payments straight to their wallet (some providers and solutions also can hold funds for a number of days).

Whereas our main goal was to integrate the cryptocurrency payments into our own solutions as standard we needed to first build up a range of tools to allow us to do so, the first was simple to get the price of any BEP20 token which has not been listed on any exchanges. There are many of these, so we saw it as a common issue.

The second goal, relied on the first to get the price, which could then work along side regular FIAT currencies to make the gateway work, with a payment confirmation built in ofcourse.

After creating these tools for ourselves, we decided to release edited versions as Wordpress Plugins for our greater community.

We will always be developing new solutions based on our needs, or the needs of our clients.
